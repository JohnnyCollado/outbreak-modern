# How we work — outbreak-modern

<!-- The card: standing facts for every agent. Never appended to; the cap is
     card.max_chars in .claude/pa.json (default 7000), enforced by the archive.
     Each role prints its slice with `tools/card.py slice <role>`.
     Written at install (interview) and edited in the same task as whatever changed it (H7). -->

## Project <!-- roles: claude expert coder planner review auditor curator -->
outbreak-modern — Recompilation of Resident Evil Outbreak with Modern Controls. Constitution `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`; roadmap `GENERATION_PLAN.md`;
rules `rules/INDEX.md`; techniques `cookbook/INDEX.md`; ops detail `docs/ops/INDEX.md`.

## Developer <!-- roles: claude planner review auditor curator -->
Who: JohnnyC96. Experience: intermediate. Domain: outbreak-modern.
Preferences: recommendations, not questions. Plain-English recaps at phase end. A notification
whenever anything waits on them. Autonomy: full inside an approved plan; stop only at the two gates. Notification channel: toast.
The developer pushes; agents never do. They ratify rules at the next plan approval.

## Rhythm <!-- roles: planner review auditor curator -->
autonomous  <!-- autonomous: the loop (the mod) runs the phase end to end, stopping
                  only at the two gates. review: tasks marked `review: yes` stop the queue with REVIEW.md. -->
Gates: plan approval (in the plan-mode view) and the milestone (confirmed by the
developer at the close question).

## Tools <!-- roles: expert coder planner review auditor curator -->
PY = C:/Users/johnn/AppData/Local/Python/pythoncore-3.14-64/python.exe

| Name | Command | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| launch | `PY tools/launch.py --state-json` | the state detector: the mod's read-only report; never typed by the developer |
| plan_edit | `PY tools/plan_edit.py` | the only writer of `PHASE_PLAN.md` (status, Changes, add/reopen) |
| status | `PY tools/status.py` | `.run/status.json` for the statusline; INBOX consume; waiting flags |
| task_log | `PY tools/task_log.py` | lint and finish a task summary |
| research_add | `PY tools/research_add.py` | allocate a report id, write the index line |
| rules_add | `PY tools/rules_add.py` | add, supersede, promote, retire a rule |
| skill_add | `PY tools/skill_add.py` | turn a `workflow:` gotcha into `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| cookbook_add | `bash tools/cookbook_add.sh` | add a cookbook entry and its index line |
| phaseend_index | `PY tools/phaseend_index.py` | assemble and archive a PhaseEnd |
| genend_index | `PY tools/genend_index.py` | assemble a GenerationEnd |
| commit_task | `bash tools/commit_task.sh` | the only commit path; explicit paths, no trailers, never pushes |
| run | `bash tools/run.sh` | any command that may print >40 lines |
| curate | `PY tools/curate.py` | `memory --route\|--reindex`, `rules --reseed\|--demote`, `cookbook --demote`, `claude-md\|card --refresh`, `how-we-work --retire`; `--dry-run` first |

## Skills <!-- roles: expert planner -->
<!-- one line per captured workflow; the SKILL.md is the canonical text -->
- <!-- TODO SKILL_NAME: no source found --> — <what it automates, when to invoke it>

## Paths <!-- roles: claude expert coder planner review auditor curator -->
- Oracles (the ground truth X3 names): <!-- TODO ORACLES: no source found -->
- Data: <!-- TODO DATA_PATHS: no source found -->
- Generated (never hand-edited, H1): <!-- TODO GENERATED_PATHS: no source found -->
- Hand-edited: <!-- TODO HAND_EDITED_PATHS: no source found -->
- Scratch: all of a phase's work in `.run/` goes under `.run/<phase>/` (gitignored; never the system temp), nowhere
  else in `.run/`. It is a temp folder only, never a home for long-term content: what the project needs lives in its
  proper place in the repo. The phase's cleanup task checks it and
  the close deletes it; a tool deletes its own temp folders when it finishes.

## Build / run / test <!-- roles: claude expert coder planner review auditor curator -->
- Build: `bash tools/run.sh ob-tools -- bash tools/ob.sh tools` (MSVC analyzer, recompiler, ps2x_tests -> C:\ob\t); `bash tools/run.sh ob-recompile -- bash tools/ob.sh recompile` (main ELF + overlays demo/submain/netdnas, then ps2EntryRunner -> C:\ob\r). Long: background shell.
- Run: `bash tools/ob.sh boot [--secs N] [--tag T]` (auto-press, frame dump to C:\ob\frames, log C:\ob\logs\boot-<tag>.log, killed after N s, default 200). Opens a VISIBLE window: needs a specific developer proceed until a hidden flag exists.
- Test / the gate: `bash tools/run.sh ob-test -- bash tools/ob.sh test` — green means ps2x_tests 461/461, IOP ctest 4/4, gs_cache ctest 45/45 (one line per suite, exit 0).
- Modes: paths from env vars, defaults under C:\ob: OB_ROOT, OB_SRC, OB_T, OB_R, OB_WORK, OB_OVL, OB_LOGS, OB_SPLAT (C:\ob\splat\SLPM_654.28), OB_RUN (repo game_files, read only), OB_VCVARS. MSVC steps run through tools/ob/vc.bat.
Long gates go through `tools/run.sh` with a raised timeout, never a poll loop.

## Environment <!-- roles: claude expert coder planner review auditor curator -->

- `docs/ops/INDEX.md` — setup, env, pins, per-topic ops notes
- `cookbook/INDEX.md` — techniques, grep by tag
- `rules/INDEX.md` — full rule texts
- `phase-ends/TASK_INDEX.md`, `phase-ends/RESEARCH_INDEX.md` — what was done and what was learned
- `docs/research-archive/` — migrated legacy reports
